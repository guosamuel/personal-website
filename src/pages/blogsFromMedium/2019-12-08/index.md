title: "Setting Up a Collaborative Project With Git and Github"
---

This topic of this blog will be slightly different than what I normally post. If you have read my previous blogs, I normally write about techniques or discoveries I encounter when working on my side projects (implementation and/or applications of specific code). For this blog, it will be about setting up the collaborative environment for a new project. This topic was inspired during a Meetup event I attended this past week.
