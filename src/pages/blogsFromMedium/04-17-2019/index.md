title: "Validating Validation (Ruby on Rails)"
---

During my second module in Flatiron boot camp, the concept of validations via Active Record was introduced to us. This topic piqued my interests because based on my limited experience with Java, the majority of my bugs were due to client input and validations are supposed to prevent that from happening, if implemented correctly. At one point, I needed to create a validation method to ensure that when an instance of my User class is created, its name attribute was unique. Unbeknownst to me, a pre-defined validation helper for uniqueness already exists but I went on to create a custom validation method to serve that purpose.
