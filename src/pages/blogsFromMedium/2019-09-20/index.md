title: "Understanding and Implementing Third Party APIs (Canvas and React DnD)"
---

During my time at Flatiron School, I think the application where I had the most fun developing is the Space X Cookie Monster game. The Space X Cookie Monster game is a one-player, survival game using vanilla Javascript and Ruby on Rails. What made this fun was the challenge of not only implementing my newfound knowledge of Javascript but also implementing the Canvas API. My partner, Joshua, and I concluded that Canvas was the best approach to allow interactions with the user throughout the game.
