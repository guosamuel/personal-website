title: "Understanding the Nuances of Different Approaches That Achieve the Same Results"

After using React for a while, one would think I would understand most of the mechanics and flow of the framework. For one of my code challenges, I ran into a new bug, one where I haven’t encountered before. At first, I was kind of clueless why this bug kept happening, and why it only happened sometimes. Was there a bug with the environment I was in? Was it because the current version of React I was using didn’t patch up this bug in the framework? Was the logic flow of my code flawed?

Coincidentally enough, this bug is also related to a lifecycle method, similar to the time where I learned I should be using the lifecycle method componentDidUpdate() .
