One of the most satisfying, yet nerve wracking, experiences is deploying your application to production for the public to use. This satisfaction comes from the success that you completed your application and all your efforts produced a tangible, functioning result. The nervousness comes from the unknown future on the application itself (i.e., What future bugs will the users come across? Is it intuitive enough where the user knows where to go? Are the users going to read the ReadMe before getting stuck? etc.).

Unfortunately for me, its was mostly the nerve wracking part that came first before the satisfaction. And per usual, I learned from this lesson as well. In hindsight, the solution was pretty easy but at the time, it was a lot of Googling and researching.
