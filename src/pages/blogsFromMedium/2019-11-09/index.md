title: "Javascript Immutability and Optimization"
---

Immutable, a buzzword that I hear a lot but never quite understood the importance of it until recently. Personally for me, its difficult for me to see the importance of anything until I understand the practical applications for it. Immutability was a topic discussed towards the end of the last ReactNYC Meetup I attended which puts this term into perspective.
