Debugging one’s code, especially your own, can get frustrating and tedious some times. It can get even more frustrating if you believe you fully understand the intricacies and the flow of the code itself. A specific occurrence of this scenario is when I kept “randomly” running into an error where it cannot read the property of null during my capstone project. Surprisingly enough, (or not), my colleague also ran into the same issues I did for his side project. Sometimes the code would compile and render as expected and sometimes an error occurs where it cannot read the property. If my colleague and I both ran into the same errors, then this is probably a much more common occurrence than expected.
