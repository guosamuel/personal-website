This past week has been hectic since it was Christmas, which meant there wasn’t much time to code. Although I wasn’t physically able to code as much as I liked, I was constantly thinking of next steps for my Group Randomizer application. Another feature I want to add is a filter feature for saved groups when the search bar is being populated. For example, if I typed in “Sam” in the search bar, all saved groups that includes “Sam” will appear.

Note: For this blog, this will be more about my thought process rather than actual code.
