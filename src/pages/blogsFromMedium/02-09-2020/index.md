Code isn’t just about making it work. Code is also about it being readable and concise such as proper indentation, appropriate naming conventions, etc. Code should also be self-documenting (which is another topic that I recommend you read into). A common convention for readable and concise code is array and object de-structuring. Array and object de-structuring is syntactic sugar for “taking apart” values and assigning those values to distinct variables.
