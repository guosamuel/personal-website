title: "An Introduction to Stacks and Queues"
---

Optimizing code is rarely an easy task. The code may be working as intended, but if it takes too long to execute, then the code is inefficient and needs to be optimized. Data structures — a necessary evil in the coding world — represent the main crux for optimization. Using the correct data structure for the correct scenario will make your code run considerably faster than using a brute-force method.
One of these data structures is stacks and queues. Personally, I feel like this is a lesser-known data structure that’s extremely easy to implement and doesn’t get enough love.
