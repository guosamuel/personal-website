title: "Approaching a Problem With Fresh Eyes and Testing Properly"
---

This week I attended the NYC Coders’ Meetup event to learn about binary search trees. We learned about binary search trees, insertion methods, breadth-first search methods, and depth-first search methods. Catherine’s blog on binary search trees does an excellent job of explaining the purpose, concept, and characteristics of a binary search tree.

As for the binary search tree methods, this blog will be about diving into the breadth-first search method (as I am confident there are plenty of resources out there that already cover creating the other binary search tree methods from scratch). The purpose of showing the breadth-first search tree method is to review the fundamental concepts of proper testing and your mentality while coding.

This might sound a bit vague — you will know exactly what I mean by the end of this piece.
