title: "Knowing When To Componentize Your Code"
---

A fundamental concept of React is that you should always be componentizing. This means that the application should always be broken up into many smaller components rather than one giant component. This will help with maintainability and scaleability in the long run versus putting all your code on one file in the short run. Although it is easy on how to componentize your application, an issue I had was when I should be componentizing. This happened on my Group Randomizer project where I dumped the majority of my functions and states into my App.js file.
