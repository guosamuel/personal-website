title: "Jumping Between Front-End and Back-End (React and Ruby on Rails)"
---

As a blooming full stack developer, one needs to have a thorough understanding of the front-end code and the back-end code. For my case, the front-end code is React, a framework based on Javascript, and the back-end code is Ruby on Rails, a framework based on Ruby. Although its important to understand the programming language/framework that I am using, I also need to fully understand how the front-end communicates with the back-end code. Otherwise, am I really a full stack developer?
