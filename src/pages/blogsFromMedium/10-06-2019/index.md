State management has come a long way in the world of React. One can use local states at the component level, Redux, or React hooks. I learned the local states at the component level and Redux, implementing them in my side projects. During my time in learning Redux, I understood what each concept did but did not understand the overall flow of it. Whenever I learned a new Redux concept, I practiced typing the necessary code until it became muscle memory but failed to see the entire picture. How did each concept fit into the overall scope of Redux?
