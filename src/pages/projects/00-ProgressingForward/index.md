Are you a project lead or supervisor that’s involved in a massive project or part of many projects? Can’t keep track of the collaborators’ tasks since they’re outside of your team? Need to wait for a task to be completed before starting yours?
<br />
Progressing Forward can help you with all of that! Progressing Forward is a project management tool where the user can see the status of their respective projects and provide status updates as necessary. No need to waste your time trying to get status updates by going through each collaborator or looking for the collaborators themselves. Focus on your top priorities without worries today!
