    question: "How would you describe yourself?",
    answer: "I’m a New Yorker through and through. With New York’s changing scenery, I would say my personality is reflected upon that. It can be as simple and calm as strolling through a park or impulsively joining an improv group to cause funny scenes in the city. Life’s always changing, so might as well hop on that wave and ride with it."
  },
  {
    question: "How did you end up in your current career?",
    answer: "Funnily enough, I wasn’t always a software developer. I got my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2014. I was in the engineering field for about 5 years. I decided to take a leap of faith to pursue coding as a software developer because it looked like technology, and code for that matter, will be at the forefront for the next upcoming years."
  },
  {
    question: "Weren’t you scared about taking that leap? What would you have done if it didn't work out?",
    answer: "Of course I was scared. Who wouldn’t be if they don’t know what’s going to happen next? If this doesn’t work, then I gained a ton of new skills and a new hobby. Overall, this strengthened my skill set to combine engineering and coding, so I’m not too worried about the future."
  },
  {
    question: "Outside of your career, what do you do for fun?",
    answer: "Oh, a myriad of things. It can be playing volleyball, trying out new restaurants, attending concerts, or attending conventions like Comic Con. I used to juggle and do archery as well so I’ve been thinking about getting back into those activities."
  },
  {
    question: "Seems like you’re just about to try anything. What are some things on your bucket list that you haven’t gotten around to yet?",
    answer: "That’s a great question. Skydiving is one of them, even though I don’t do well with heights. Archery tag is also on that list which is like paintball but with bows and arrows and the tips are covered. Probably explore the states a bit more too where their food is famous, like New Orleans for cajun food."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your favorite quote and why?",
    answer: "It would be “Don’t worry about it.” This was my motto when I was a teenager and it trickled down into adulthood. As a teenager, the pressure of doing academically well, maintaining a social life, staying healthy, applying for colleges, attending extracurriculars, and developing emotionally was a lot to handle. That phrase helped me recognize you can only do so much at once, so as long as you put in the effort, everything else should play out naturally."
  },
  {
    question: "Wow, who would’ve thought a simple phrase like that would’ve stuck and motivated you to this day. All right, I think it’s about time we wrapped this up. Any last words you have for those out there reading this right now?",
    answer: "First, thank you for reading the entire page. Hopefully I was able to shed some light on who I am.
