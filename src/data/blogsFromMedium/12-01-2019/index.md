I decided to start a new side project called “Group Randomizer”. The inspiration behind this was whenever my friends and I were to split up into groups, whether it was for sports, video games, pair programming, etc., we wouldn’t know how to split up (whoo, shoutout for indecisiveness!). I figured the fairest way possible is through randomization. We used to write matching numbers on pieces of paper, fold it, throw it all in a hat, and randomly picked slips of paper (slightly embarrassed to admit how long we’ve been doing this given today’s technology) until everyone was grouped up.

Like every project out there, I hit my first snag, which also tested my understanding on one of the core principles in Javascript.
