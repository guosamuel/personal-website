title: "Custom Routes With Mirage JS"
---

In the last ReactNYC Meetup, (yes, the same one that I referenced to in my previous blog), a new technology was introduced to me: Mirage JS.

Mirage JS is an API mocking library that lets you build, test and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to rely on any backend services.

Mirage JS accomplishes this by creating a mock server and intercepts any network requests to the mock server in lieu of an official server. It creates the mock server within the browser. Sam Selikoff gave an introductory presentation on how to jump start your React application with a mock server via Mirage JS. He presented Mirage JS by using RESTful conventions for the mock server and a mock database to accompany those conventions.
