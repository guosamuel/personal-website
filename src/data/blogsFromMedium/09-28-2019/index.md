Currently I am working on a side project, called Dice Burglars, that was inspired by a tabletop game that I purchased recently called Furglars. Essentially, the purpose of the game is to be the first to accumulate 15 points. The player accumulates points by holding onto dice that they rolled for at least one full round. A round is defined as all players taking their turn before it’s the player’s turn again. Throughout the round, depending on what the player rolled, the player may be able to steal dice from other players.
